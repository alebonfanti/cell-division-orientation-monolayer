# Network model to study cell division orientation in epithelia monolayers

To gain a conceptual understanding of how tension in mitotic cells evolves relative to the tension 
in interphase cells and in the tissue, we devised a simple computational model of the monolayer as 
a purely elastic 2D material in which cells have a preset active tension and rigidity. By varying tension, 
rigidity and position of the boundaries, we aim to reproduce a range of experimental conditions and 
characterize the distribution of stress in the viscinity of the mitotic cell. 
The simulated scenarios are:
1. monolayer in its initial configuration clamped at both ends is subjected to a tensile stress due to cell contractility
2. the monoalyer with internal cell contractility is compressed
3. the internal contractility is increased while the monolayer is under a compressive state
4. the internal contractility of a clamped monolayer is reduced
5. the monolayer with reduced contractility is stretched
